# 🛡 RushSafe — Emergency Shelter & Medical Aid Finder


This project, titled “RushSafe”, was originally built as part of a hackathon project.  

*RushSafe* is an emergency web app that helps people in *Israel* quickly find nearby *bomb shelters* and *medical supplements* (like CPR devices, AEDs, or first-aid kits) during emergency situations.
It uses *real-time GPS, **interactive maps, and **community-powered data* to guide users safely and efficiently to protection or medical assistance.
